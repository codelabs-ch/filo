/*
   Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
   literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
   available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
   When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
   example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
   inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

   Entry assumptions:

	state->mode == LEN
	strm->avail_in >= 6
	strm->avail_out >= 258
	start >= strm->avail_out
	state->bits < 8

   On return, state->mode is one of:

	LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
	TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
	BAD -- error in block data

   Notes:

    - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
      length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
      and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
      Therefore if strm->avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
      checking for available input while decoding.

    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
      requires strm->avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
      output space.

       Process a set of code lengths to create a canonical Huffman code.  The
       code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the
       symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the
       symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order
       for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits
       for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer
       increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length
       increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards
       from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the
       decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes
       are incremented backwards.

       This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in
       lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.
       1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that
       symbol does not occur in this code.

       The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,
       creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the
       sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted
       table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by
       the caller.

       The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding
       the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any
       codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead
       at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the

       Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being
       filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff
       with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop
       bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,
       those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to
       fill the table with replicated entries.

       root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds
       root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index
       of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a
       new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is
       being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.

       When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the
       code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length
       counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are
       entered in the tables.

       used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the
       provided *table space.  It is checked when a LENS table is being made
       against the space in *table, ENOUGH, minus the maximum space needed by
       the worst case distance code, MAXD.  This should never happen, but the
       sufficiency of ENOUGH has not been proven exhaustively, hence the check.
       This assumes that when type == LENS, bits == 9.

       sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when
       all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This
       routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills
       in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.

/*
   inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as
   much output data as possible before returning.  The state machine is
   structured roughly as follows:

    for (;;) switch (state) {
    ...
    case STATEn:
	if (not enough input data or output space to make progress)
	    return;
	... make progress ...
	state = STATEm;
	break;
    ...
    }

   so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and
   if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the
   next state.  The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates
   whether it can proceed or should return.  NEEDBITS() does the return if
   the requested bits are not available.  The typical use of the BITS macros
   is:

	NEEDBITS(n);
	... do something with BITS(n) ...
	DROPBITS(n);

   where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn't enough
   input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues.  BITS(n)
   gives the low n bits in the accumulator.  When done, DROPBITS(n) drops
   the low n bits off the accumulator.  INITBITS() clears the accumulator
   and sets the number of available bits to zero.  BYTEBITS() discards just
   enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary.  After BYTEBITS()
   and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.

   NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return
   if there is no input available.  The decoding of variable length codes uses
   PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next
   code, and no more.

   Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough
   state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off
   if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop.  For example, want, need, and keep
   would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS()
   returns:

    case STATEw:
	while (want < need) {
	    NEEDBITS(n);
	    keep[want++] = BITS(n);
	    DROPBITS(n);
	}
	state = STATEx;
    case STATEx:

   As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break
   is omitted.

   A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to
   complete that state.  Those states are copying stored data, writing a
   literal byte, and copying a matching string.

   When returning, a "goto inf_leave" is used to update the total counters,
   update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made
   during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code.
   Progress is defined as a change in either strm->avail_in or strm->avail_out.
   When there is a window, goto inf_leave will update the window with the last
   output written.  If a goto inf_leave occurs in the middle of decompression
   and there is no window currently, goto inf_leave will create one and copy
   output to the window for the next call of inflate().

   In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the
   return code (per zlib.h).  inflate() always writes as much as possible to
   strm->next_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect
   documented in zlib.h of Z_SYNC_FLUSH.  Furthermore, inflate() always defers
   the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which
   provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z_FINISH when the entire input
   stream available.  So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is:
   when flush is set to Z_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z_OK.  Instead it
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream.
