    * make grub user interface more Redhatish
    * add menu.lst password support
    * drop serial initialization if no speed specified
    * add USB stack (not used yet but compiling)

Version 0.5b1 stepan 2005-10-01
    * Integrate grub user interface
    
Version 0.4.2 ts1 2003-10-31
    * Added brute force method of PCI scan (turned off by default.)
    * Workaround for CD drives that report unusual sector size.

Version 0.4.1 ts1 2003-10-30
    * Fixed IDE driver for older hard disks (such as WD Caviar 1.2G)
    * Fixed wrong sector number in the disk read error message
    * Fixed inaccurate display of hard disk capacity
    * Fixed behavior of word erase (^W) for one character
    * Updated README and FAQ

Version 0.4 ts1 2003-10-15
    * Support for ATAPI CD-ROM.
    * ISO-9660 filesystem is taken from a GRUB patch by
      Leonid Lisovskiy <lly@pisem.net>. The filesystem code was originally
      written by Kousuke Takai <tak@kmc.gr.jp> for GRUB/98 project.
    * Support for mounting boot disk image of El Torito bootable CD-ROM.
      ("hdc1" means the boot disk image of the CD-ROM at hdc.)
    * Support for memory as device, raw device as image, and
      user-specifiable device offset and length.
      (eg. boot: mem@0xfffd0000,0x10000)
    * PCI support in IDE driver. Now it by default uses PCI enumeration
      to find the PCI IDE controller, and can use native PCI mode
      if the controller is configured to this mode by BIOS.
      To disable this, turn off SUPPORT_PCI.
    * Fixed Linux loader to boot RedHat 9 kernel properly.

Version 0.3 ts1 2003-10-07
    * Added loader for Linux bzImage/zImage/Image (a.k.a. /vmlinuz).
      Many thanks to Steve Gehlbach <steve@nexpath.com> for early
      work on this.
    * New "context switch" routine to unify the assembly starters
      for ELF and Linux, and even the C startup.
      This reduced the amount of assembly code.
    * Debug prints are now automatically prefixed with function names.
    * Lots of internal tweaks.

Version 0.2 ts1 2003-09-19
    * Added code to pass kernel command line parameter from console.
    * Changed not to disable automatic boot by ANY key. Now you have to
      press <Esc> to cancel autoboot. This fixes the problem that FILO
      gets stuck at boot prompt when a phantom byte is read from
      a fickle serial or keyboard hardware.
      Additionaly, now <Enter> key does autoboot immediately.
    * Fixed build problem with new coreutils.
      Thanks to Stefan Reinauer <stepan@suse.de>.
    * Updated fsys_fat.c and fsys_reiserfs.c from GRUB CVS.
    * Lots of minor tweaks.
    * Beginning of PCI layer and a sound driver (what??). Don't worry,
      it doesn't even get compiled with default configuration.

Version 0.1 ts1 2003-08
    * First public release.
