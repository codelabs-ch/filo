Q. My GRUB menu.lst does not work. 
A. The disks are numbered differently in FILO, following the linux scheme.
   hd2,0 is hdc1, not necessarily the third disk (there might be no hdb)

Q. FILO loads my ELF kernel fine, but complains "Verify FAILED".
A. Try the newer version of mkelfImage instead of the one from the
   freebios tree. It's available at ftp://ftp.lnxi.com/pub/mkelfImage/ .

Q. LinuxBIOS (v1 tree) crashes or fails to verify checksum when booting FILO.
A. Make sure you are using the latest source of LinuxBIOS. It had a bug
   that interferes with checksum calculation, until recently.
