Please report suggestions for this file to stepan@coresystems.de

Features
    - finish "find" implementation in main/grub/builtins.c
    - finish print_completions implementation in main/grub/completions.c
    - enter grub command line interface if no menu.lst is found, instead
      of hanging forever.

Cleanup
    - Cleanup addresses specified in include/grub/shared.h. That looks
      dangerous to plain wrong.

Devices/Drivers
    - create a list of all available devices (and search this on for menu.lst
      or "find" or tab completion)
    - USB keyboard/Serial support
    - Full & tested USB support

CD/DVD Boot support
    - gather syslinux config files from CDs/DVDs and add their entries
      to the menu. (Create a menu if syslinux config files are found
      but no menu.lst)

SCSI
    - yeah, scsi support, good point. This is an open issue in LinuxBIOS
      for now. Int13 support somehow?

Config File Support

    - search for a menu.lst rather than hardcoding it?!?

      Maybe store this information (device type, drive number, partition number)
      to the CMOS, so finally we won't have to have it hardcoded in the flash?

    - we're parsing a grub menu.lst right now, but we should also be able to
      read syslinux.cfg

    - We can have an entry in hard disk's filo.cfg to boot from CD-ROM.
      If this entry is selected, filo.cfg from CD-ROM is read.
